A healing potion costs 50 gold coins. For each character with an account balance of at least 100, calculate how many healing potions it can buy (column name potion_amount) and how much money it will have left as a result of that purchase (column change). Round the first column down to integers.
SELECT floor(account_balance/50) as potion_amount, mod(account_balance,50) as change
FROM character 
WHERE account_balance >= 100
Each warrior (class = 'warrior') at level 3 or higher can perform a special attack whose damage is calculated as follows: its strength plus one fourth of its hp, and then multiplied by the absolute value of stat_modifier. Round this column to 2 decimal places.
Show the name and special attack damage (column damage) calculated for those characters which have the attack available.
SELECT name, round((strength + 1/4.0 * hp) * abs(stat_modifier), 2) AS damage
FROM character
WHERE class = 'warrior'
    AND level > 2;
For players with IDs equal to 1 and 5, show firstname and lastname together with the level, height rounded to two decimal places, and account_balance rounded down. The column names should be: firstname, lastname, level, height, and account_balance.
SELECT p.firstname, p.lastname, c.level, round(cast(c.height as numeric),2) as height, floor(c.account_balance) as account_balance
FROM player as p join character as c
ON p.id = c.player_id
WHERE p.id in (1, 5)
For each aircraft produced in 2010, show its id, production date and the distinctive codes of routes they operate on (rename the column to route_code).
SELECT distinct a.id, a.produced, f.route_code as route_code
FROM aircraft as a join flight as f
ON a.id = f.aircraft_id
WHERE a.produced between '2010-01-31' and '2010-12-31'
For all the aircraft launched in 2013 or 2014, show their id and launch date. Sort by the column launched from the newest to the oldest dates.
SELECT id, launched
FROM aircraft
WHERE launched >= '2013-01-01' and launched <='2015-01-01'
ORDER BY launched desc
