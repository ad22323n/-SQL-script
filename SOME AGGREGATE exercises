Count all the rows in the table project (name the column all_projects), then count those rows where price is not NULL (name the column projects_with_price)

FROM project

The agency manager gets a bonus of 5 for each project which got some feedback.
Show the theoretical sum the project manager could get if all the projects got some feedback (theoretical_bonus) and the actual bonus (actual_bonus).
SELECT count(*) * 5 as theoretical_bonus, count(feedback)*5 as actual_bonus
FROM project

The feedback of 0 doesn't mean anything to agency managers. They want to find out how many projects got meaningful (non-zero) feedback.
Count the number of project with non-zero feedback. Name the column projects_no
SELECT count(feedback) as projects_no
FROM project
WHERE feedback != 0
